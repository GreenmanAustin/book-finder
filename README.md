# Book Search Engine Refactor

 ## Description

 This application involved a refactor of existing code for a MERN built book search engine with personalized book save functionality.  Specifically, the existing code used RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on book data.  The refactor involved switching the existing APIs to GraphQl built with Apollo Server.  The refactor involved deploying the Apollo Server, creating new queries and mutations, and refactoring significant code in the front end and back end.
